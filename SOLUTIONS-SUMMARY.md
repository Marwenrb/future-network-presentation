# Solutions Summary - Future Network Presentation

## 🖼️ Problem 1: Old Images Still Showing on Website

### Root Cause
Browsers cache images to improve loading speed. Even though you've updated the image files, browsers are still showing the old cached versions.

### ✅ Solutions Applied

1. **Fixed File Extensions**: Updated HTML to use correct file extensions:
   - Changed `Images/6.png` → `Images/6.jpeg?v=2`
   - Changed `Images/7.png` → `Images/7.jpeg?v=2`
   - Changed `Images/8.png` → `Images/8.jpeg?v=2`
   - Changed `Images/10.png` → `Images/10.jpeg?v=2`
   - Changed `Images/11.png` → `Images/11.jpeg?v=2`
   - Added `?v=2` to logo images

2. **Cache-Busting Parameters**: Added `?v=2` to all image URLs to force browser refresh

### 🔄 Next Steps for Image Issue

1. **Upload Updated Files**: Upload the updated `future-network-presentation.html` to your hosting service
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: 
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) on your website
   - Or clear browser cache completely in settings
3. **Test**: Visit https://future-network-presentation.netlify.app/ to see updated images

## 📄 Problem 2: PDF Generation with Overlapping Content

### Root Cause
The PDF generation script had layout issues with text positioning and spacing, causing content to overlap.

### ✅ Solutions Applied

1. **Improved Text Spacing**: Increased margins between sections
2. **Better Text Wrapping**: Used `splitTextToSize()` for proper text wrapping
3. **Adjusted Font Sizes**: Reduced font sizes to prevent overflow
4. **Fixed Positioning**: Repositioned all elements with proper spacing
5. **Enhanced Color Swatches**: Improved spacing and sizing of color elements

### 📊 PDF Layout Improvements

- **Title**: Positioned at y=30
- **Header Info**: y=50, 60, 70
- **Logo Concept**: y=95, text at y=105
- **Logo Design**: y=140, text at y=150
- **Brand Colors**: y=180, swatches from y=200-238
- **Logo Applications**: y=260, list from y=280-300
- **Footer**: y=320-335

### 🔄 Test PDF Generation
